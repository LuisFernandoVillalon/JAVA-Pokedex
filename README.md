# JAVA-Pokedex
My final project for my Introduction to Data Structures in Java class in college. 

# Summary
The application's GUI displays a list of Pokemon with their respective type listed in numerical order. 
Depending on the Pokemon's type the text displaying the information changes color. The user has the 
option to view a certain type at once or all of them at once. As well as sorting the list from ascending 
and desceiding alphabetically and numerically.I applied everything I was taught, including implementing sorting
algorithms and building and working aound data structures. Javafx was used to to create the graphical user interface (GUI)
for the user to interact with the data. Images were used to represent the stick figure.
